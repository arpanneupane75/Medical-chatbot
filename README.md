## Project Overview

The Medical Chatbot leverages state-of-the-art language models like Groq LLaMA 4 and HuggingFace Falcon 7B to answer users' medical queries. It supports uploading medical documents (PDF, TXT, DOCX), uses vector-based retrieval for relevant context, and falls back to Wikipedia when needed. The chatbot includes intent classification to ensure medical relevance and optional text-to-speech for accessibility.

## Features

- Upload and process medical documents (PDF, TXT, DOCX) for context-aware answers
- Vector store creation and updating using FAISS and embeddings
- Zero-shot intent classification for medical relevance
- Support for Groq LLaMA 4 and HuggingFace Falcon 7B language models
- Intelligent fallback to Wikipedia summary for unanswered questions
- Text-to-Speech functionality for answers
- Clean, interactive Streamlit web interface with chat history and source document previews
